This is the device tree for Meizu m2 note by Kevin.MX (aaawqw@xda), port from Elephone P8000
Recently added some codes to fix problems, such as CPU temperature.
Thanks ShevT@4pda for his codes:)
This device tree can be used for building TWRP from CM12.1 and TWRP source. I haven't tried to build CM12.1.
Any problem please contact aaawqw@live.cn
